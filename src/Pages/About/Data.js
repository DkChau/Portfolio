    Hi, Iâ€™m Duong Chau. An aspiring web developer from Texas.

    Over the course of the pandemic I discovered my love for coding and design and decided to embark on a year-long journey into web development and specifically Javascript.
    
    My approach to coding and javascript specifically is based on my mechanical engineering background. An approach that involves mastering all the nuances and quirks of javascript, from types and objects to coercion and comparisons. Mastery of the fundamentals is a long term investment that enhances the rate at which I will be able to adapt to new technology because everything builds on top of the fundamentals at the end of the day.
    
    I specialize in React for front-end design and Express for server-side apps and am currently in the process of learning Figma in order to implement prototyping into my projects.
    
    I've learned a lot throughout the year, but Javascript is an ever-growing language and I realize that there is still much more to learn.

    Towards the end of my college career, I realized that I was not enjoying mechanical engineering as much as I wish I had. 

    The parts of mechanical engineering that I truly loved and excelled at all were subjects relating to design and analysis. Designing and creating simulations with programs such as CREO, Abaqus, and MATLAB were some of my favorite things to do in mechanical engineering, but despite performing well academically, I did not find myself passionate about the career.

    So during the course of the pandemic I took a risk and decided to search for an career that involved not only the design/analysis aspects of mechanical engineering I loved, but also, a career that I can imagine myself enjoying ten years down the line. 
    
    And I think I was able to find that with web development.
